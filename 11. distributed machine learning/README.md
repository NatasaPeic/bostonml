**Distributed Machine Learning**
===================

Arno Candel, Chief Architect @ [H2O](http://h2o.ai/)  

Arno's talk focused on the implementation and application of distributed machine learning algorithms such as Elastic Net, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Deep Neural Networks.

Prior to joining H2O Arno was a founding MTS at Skytree where he designed high-performance algorithms. He has over a decade of experience in hpc and had access to the worldâ€™s largest supercomputers at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory where he participated in US DOE initiatives and collaborated with CERN on particle accelerators.
