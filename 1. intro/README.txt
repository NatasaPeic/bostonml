Imran Malek, Systems Engineer at DataXu's workshop introducing Data Science with Python.

This year, at both the Boston Data Conference and the Tufts Data Science club Imran Malek gave a talk on the basics of iPython and how people can use iPython in conjunction with publicly available data sets to generate interesting visualizations.

This post serves as a reference for the talk as it has links to everything that you need to get started.
