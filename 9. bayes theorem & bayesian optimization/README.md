**Bayes Theorem & Bayesian Optimization**
===================

##Talks:

###[Allen Downey](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/) - Bayes's Theorem and German Tanks

Prof. Downey presented on the basics of Bayesian statistics, starting with Bayes's theorem. He also took us through the German tank problem, an application of Bayesian statistics used by Allied analysts during World War II. His talk used Python code, but was accessible to people with minimal Python knowledge.
