##Bios:

David is a postdoc in the [Harvard Intelligent Probabilistic Systems Group](http://hips.seas.harvard.edu/) working on model based optimization, synthetic chemistry, Bayesian numerics, and neural networks. He also cofounded [Invenia](http://invenia.ca/), an energy forecasting and trading firm where he still consults.

Alec is a cofounder at [indico](https://indico.io/), and has been on leave from school at Olin College since getting into Techstars for the Boston 2014 batch. He heads up indico's research efforts and has extensive experience applying RNNs and CNNs to text and image problems using Python's Theano library. When not playing with GPUs, Alec is an avid scuba diver.

Alex is pursuing a PhD in Neuroscience at Harvard University and received his BS in Neuroscience from the University of Michigan. He has created mobile and scientific software used by tens of thousands of people in classrooms and laboratories around the world. Alex cofounded [Whetlab](https://www.whetlab.com/), a company building an assembly line for artificial intelligence. He's excited to work on Whetlab because it will rapidly accelerate the pace and quality of research and design, enabling new tools and treatments. Alex lives in Brookline, MA with his girlfriend and their plants.
