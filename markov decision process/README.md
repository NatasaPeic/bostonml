Decision-making under uncertainty is the problem of acting in complex environments in ways that maximize cumulative reward. Alborz Geramifard, Research Scientist at Amazon, lead an introductory workshop on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) which serve as a natural framework for formulating such problems.

Reinforcement learning and dynamic programming are common solutions to MDPs and have been demonstrated to play backgammon, fly helicopters in acrobatic maneuvers, and automatically read and follow instructions in Microsoft tech support articles. This tutorial covered the basics of MDPs and discussed how reinforcement learning, and dynamic programing methods could be used to solve MDPs. All algorithms covered are available through the open-source RLPy package.
