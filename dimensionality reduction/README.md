**Dimensionality Reduction**
===================

Daniel Steinberg is a PhD candidate at University of Pittsburgh. His talk focused on techniques for dimensionality reduction including principal component analysis and multidimensional 
scaling. He also covered more recent non-linear methods including isomaps, locally linear embedding, and laplacian eigenmaps.  | [Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwC1eSaTX5cZa0RjejlEeEpGTlE/view?usp=sharing)
